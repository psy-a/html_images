<h1>Welcome to Art 101</h1>
<p>
  Art is the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form such as painting or sculpture,<br>
  producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power.
</p>
<p>
  In simple terms, Art is generally understood as any activity or product done by people with a communicative or aesthetic purpose,<br>
  something that expresses an idea, an emotion or, more generally, a world view.<br> 
  It is a component of culture, reflecting economic and social substrates in its design.

<p>
  Different people have different views or perspectives towards art.
  This has led to a never ending debate of what art is good and what art is bad.
</p>
<p> 
  You may have seen simple art pieces sell for millions or dollars which to your view shouldn't cost more than a <a href="http://starbucks.com" target="_blank">Starbucks</a> coffee.
  What does this tell us?
</p>
<p>
  This proves the proverbial statement of "beauty lies in the eyes of the Beholder."

Since we have established that everyone has his/her view on which art is good or bad, how do you know your taste for art?
<p>I know mine I love the siple colorful art pieces, either abstract or otherwise.
<p>I like to be able to see the background, feel the weather, place myself in the piece so I can understand what the artist was trying to convey.

<p>
  No matter what your taste in art is, the fact is, we all enjoy art.
<ul>
  <li>We live because of art.</li>
  <li>We kill boredom with art.</li>
  <li>We learn with art.</li>
  <li>We motivate with art.</li>
